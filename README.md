### Layout & Responsiveness
The design focuses on a mobile-first responsive layout, stacking elements vertically and centering the main content. The desktop view introduces more spacing and larger images for readability.

### Branding
The site uses a clean and modern palette:
- Primary: Blue `#0077cc`
- Danger (delete): Red `#ff4b4b`
- Backgrounds alternate between light and dark modes.

Typography is set to *Poppins* for both headings and body text to ensure visual consistency and accessibility.

### User Flow
- Users select a date and view NASA's APOD.
- Images can be favorited and stored in local storage.
- Dark/light mode toggle allows accessibility for different viewing conditions.
